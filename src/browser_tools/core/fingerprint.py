"""Browser fingerprint profiles for anti-detection.

Loads fingerprint profiles from JSON and exposes the values that
``launch_browser`` applies via Chrome command-line flags and environment:
user agent, viewport, language, and timezone.

This module intentionally does NOT inject JavaScript to override navigator
properties (``webdriver`` / ``platform`` / ``vendor`` / ``window.chrome``).
An empirical detection audit (``planning/03-specs/BRW-03-learnings/01-detection-audit.md``)
showed those overrides are each independently detectable and make the browser
*more* detectable, not less: they flip bot.sannysoft.com's WebDriver test from
pass to fail (the override makes ``navigator.webdriver`` an own property -- a
tamper signature), expose arrow-function getters where natives are expected,
replace ``window.chrome`` with a wrong-shaped stub, and raise CreepJS's
headless heuristic from 0% to 33%.

A plain CDP-attached Chrome already reports ``navigator.webdriver`` as the
native ``false`` and keeps the genuine ``window.chrome`` shape, so the right
move is to leave the JS environment untouched and only spoof what can be set
cleanly at launch. ``platform`` and ``vendor`` are retained in the profile
schema for compatibility and documentation but are not spoofed -- a profile's
platform should match the host OS (WebGL/font signals leak the real OS anyway).
